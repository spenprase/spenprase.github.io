## Research Interests

My research is focused on interactions between glaciers and rivers and understanding how changes in glaciation impact the shape and behavior of rivers around them. I'm focusing this work on two field areas in southeastern Minnesota and Argentina. My research uses a wide range of tools including many geochronological methods, working with remote datasets, and (my favorite) lots of fieldwork.
